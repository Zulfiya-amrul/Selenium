Locators: xpath, css selector

Why do we need XPath and Css selector ?

-- developers will not provide all the locators in html
-- by using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an XPath?

-- xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the webpage

types of XPath:
Absolute x path-
--will start from the starting node of the HTML ( html tag )
--will always start with a single slash /
e.g.  /html/body/div/div/div

Relative X path --> starts from any node in the htlm
it always starts with double slash //

syntax for relative x path with attributes
// tagName [ @attribute = 'attribute value' ]
//input[@id='email'] on right side it shows its 1 out of 1


identifying elements by its text:
// tagname [text( ) = 'text value ']
another example
//h2[text() = 'Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

identifying elements using contains method
// tagname [contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value']

starts with will identifly the elements with partial starting valye
//tagname [starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value']
//button[starts-with(@data-testid, 'royal')]


tags what they mean

<div > - division
<img > -- image
<h> --- header
<p> --- paragraph
<li> -- list
<ul> -- unordered list
<ol> -- order list
<br> -- breaking line


start with id the with name then with xpath

advanced xpath- parent and child relationships

identifying elemnts by following siblings
//tagname[@attribute=‘attribute value’]/following-sibling::tagname


indentify elemnts by preceing siblinggs
//tagname[@attribute=‘attribute value’]
//input[@id= 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

indentifying an element by its ancestor
//tagname[@attribute=‘attribute value’]/ancestor::
