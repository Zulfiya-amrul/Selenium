DropDowns
DropDown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

Types of Dropdowns
1.Single select
2.Multiple select

Handling Dropdowns:
1. click on dropdown and click on the option
2. using Select class (select class selenium)
            in order to use Select class we need to make sure our dropdown has select tag in the DOM

 Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
 1. by index
 2. by visible text
 3. by value

whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside the container such as List, Set, Maps...

In order to deselect any option in dropdown:
-- Make sure your DD is multiple select
deselectByValue()
deselectByVisibleText()
deselectByIndex()
deselectAll()
