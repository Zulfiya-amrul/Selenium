Selenium Class 6
Alerts :
Alert is a pop-up message. Alert takes the complete focus of main page that we are working on
we cannon proceed until it is handled
3 types of alerts
1. web base alert/html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions (EXAMPLE FACEBOOK SIGN UP-POP UP)
2. java-script alert/browser alerts - completely takes the action of the mail page,MAINLY WE WILL WORK WITH THIS ALERT
                        we can handle these alerts by using switchTo methods
                        we cannot inspect any of the java-script alerts
3. windows base alert - we cannot handle with selenium
    EXAMPLE - WHEN UPLOADING FILES WE GET A POP-UP FILE FROM OUR COMPUTER, WE CANT INTERACT WITH THESE TYPE OF ALERTS IN SELENIUM


Types of JavaScript alerts
    1. simple alert
    2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click okay
    3. prompt alert--- we need to enter a text, or cancel without sending

to handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods
1. accept( ) click ok
2.dismiss() click cancel - will locate cancel button but if cancel button not there it will click on okay button
3.getText()
4.sendKeys()

to handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the url
"https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
                                        //  username:password@

   Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage separate from the window that we are working on
Frames allow developers to represent multiple views on one page
3 methods to interact with frames:
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

interview question
how do we handle alerts in selenium
we handle alerts by using alert interface
