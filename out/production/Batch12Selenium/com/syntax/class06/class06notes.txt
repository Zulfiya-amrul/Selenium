Selenium Class 6
Alerts :
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts takes a complete focus of main page that we are working on
we cannon procced until it is handled
3 types of alerts
1. web base alert/html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. java-script alert/ browser alerts - completely takes the action of the mail page,\
                        we can handle these alerts by using switchTo methods
                        we cannot inspect
3. windows base alert - we cannont handle with selenium

Types of Java script alerts
    1. simple alert
    2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click okay
    3. prompt alert--- we need to enter a text, or cancel without sending

to handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods
1. accept( ) click ok
2.dismiss() click cancel
3.getText()
4.sendKeys()

to handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the url
"https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
                                        //  username:password@

   Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow developers to represent multiple views on one page
3 methods to interact with frames:
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webElement

in alerts - switch to alert and swtich automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page
