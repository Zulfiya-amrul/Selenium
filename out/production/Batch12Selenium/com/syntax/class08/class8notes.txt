Selenium class 8

what are window handles:
unique ID for window or a tab, its a 40-41 alpha numberic character ID
what methods we use  to handle windows
getWindowHandle() -- we are getting a string value in return, the Unique Id of the current tab that sel. is focused
getWindowHandles()-- we are getting a Set of Strings in return, a set of unique IDs, or a Set of unique tabs in the browser session
                    ---> we store everything in a set, and use an iterator to perform actions
                    ---> created a while loop
                    ---> started iterating through the while loop--to switch to other windows, we get the titles, accept domain widows


implicit wait:
- will be applied for find element method
- it is a global waits
- it will work to locate the element once the element is found it will ignore the remainder of the time and move on to next step
- you only implement the implicit waits once in the application
- it will reset to 20  seconds on each element


Explicit wait or webDriver wait:
is used to tell web-driver to wait for a certain condition before throwing an exception for a specified condition ONLY
--- sometimes the element is not the state that we want it to be, so we can use explicit waits to wait for that element to be
                                                                            -clickable
                                                                             -enabled
                                                                             -disabled
                                                                             -element present

--explicit wait works with expectedConditions class, and it waits until certain conditions are met on the given time/// or the given time is achieved

- waits until certain conditions are met,
- explicit wait works with expectedConditions class and waits until certain conditions are met or the given time is achieved

expectedConditions is an interface and we use that in our class

* this sign in xpath is a wild card which can identify any tag-name
//*[text()='Welcome Syntax Technologies']
//* [contains(text(), 'Welcome')]

Fluent wait- considered to be global wait-- you mention it once and it is applied for the whole script
- used to tell web-driver for certain conditions and the frequency

Implicit wait - waits to locate the element
Explicit wait - waits until certain condition
Fluent wait - sets timeout, polling time, and ignores needed exceptions in the given time period


WebTables;
WebTables are elements on the webpage, which are constructed by having rows and columns
Types of WebTables
1) static WebTable - doest change in table, the data is static, the data is constant

2) dynamic webTable- data change does happen

WebTables consists of different sections or parts ---- header and body
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th> -- column data or heading data
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td> </td>-- actual table data
            </tr>
     </tbody>
 </table>
-- sometimes we dont have a separate HTML for the header and it is all inside the body
