Selenium Architecture
1- selenium client library (Selenium project on IDE - Batch12Selenium on IntelliJ using java- example)

2- takes the code we have written and converts it into -- > Json format

3- the code in Json format is send to Browser Drivers (example chrome.driver or gecko driver)
                                            - selenium communicated with browsers using Browser Drivers tool

4- the browser driver communicates directly with actual browser -

5- the browser will now follow the set of instructions that were send by driver

6- the actual browser gives a response to our driver, the driver converts that response back into Json format
the Json format will go back into local machine and will give us a read out  ( report, print something so on )
