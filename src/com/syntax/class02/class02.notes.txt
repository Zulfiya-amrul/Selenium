What is Selenium?
set of tools,
has 4 components - IDE, Grid, RCE, webDriver
webDriver- open source automation tool, - we can work/test with web applications,

advantages - supports diferent programing languages, open source, works with different operating systems

disadvantages- no builtin support, cant test images videos or capchas those are done manually

1)set properties - need to mention our driver and the path,
2) create object of the webdriver -- launches the browser


Selenium Class 2

What is a web element- anything we see on the webpage is considered a web element
- example --> any text, checkboxes, links, textboxes.
each web element is identified inside the HTML

What is HTML - hyperText Markup Language - where we start to design our website-
format what we will have on th web is made by html

DOM - document object model- his section of the webpage opens up when we click on inspect
-- DOM is browsers internal view of the webpage
-- it is also called as developer tools or Dev tools

            --DOM--
Document --> Artifact, anything can be stored inside, for the DOM we are working on now HTML is stored
Object -->  any line in html is considered an object
Model -- > it is just the layout of the HTML

- the actual design on the website is made by the language CSS, the functionalities are made on HTML


Locator in Selenium
-address that identifies Web Elements, or group of Web Elements uniquely, within the DOM
-- its a position of the webElements
-- we need to tell selenium which web element we want it to work with to perform any actions

Locator
- is an address or a position of a webelement o the web page
- it is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage

we have 8 different locators - we have 8 ways to identify the element that we are looking for,
we have 8 ways to tell our selenium on what to interact with


1- ID- most unique locator
2- Name
3- TagName
4- Xpath
5- LinkTxt
6- PartialLinktext
7- CSS Selector
8- ClassName


when do we use linktxt or patrtiallink txt - whenever we have a link, a tag

HTML Scripting Meaning
first words in BLUE- tags  - button, div, form, input
words in   WHITE - name, autocomplete, id, class  -- > considered to be attributes in HTML
ORANGE - ATTRIBUTE VALUE, hidden, post, off,

Why do we need many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators might have duplicate values in different nodes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
ex. LinkText and partialLinktext are only used for links
"a" tag is also called an anchor tag and is used to identifly a line that has a link


if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values,
selenium will only interact with the first element if locates
