thread.sleep() -- static wait / uncoditional wait

types of selenium waits
implicit wait
explicit wait
fluent wait

implicit wait --- works with findElement(  ) method
tells webDriver to wait certain about of time before throwing an exception, will be applied to the whole session of execution
- it tells the web-driver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception,
it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of excecution
we can say that implicit wait is global wait
implicit wait is usually set for  20 seconds,
if your element is found in any time between the given time the remaining time will be ignored and your script will move to next line or action
if the element is not found in the given time, only then you will get an exception
